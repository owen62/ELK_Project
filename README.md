# ELK_Project

## Context :

The main goal of this Practical work is to put in place a docker container (for example a web server : nginx, apache) using a docker-compose.yml file 
Once the docker container created, we are going to retrieve the logs inside this container and put it inside the ELK stack.

## Launch :

You can launch the docker containers using the following command :

```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d 
```

You're now allowed to access to the graphical interface of the ELK stack Kibana typing localhost:5601 in the Url of your browser (Username: elastic, Password: pass@123).
